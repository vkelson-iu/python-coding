## Python Programming Spring 2020 weeks 6-10
### Instructor Vic Kelson, vkelson@indiana.edu (office hours by appointment)

### Prerequisites
A desire to enhance your use of computing systems

### Textbook
"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" (Miller et al.). This is available for free as an interactive book with live example code, at this location (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. A hardcopy or Kindle edition may also be purchased from Amazon at this link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. I intend to work from the interactive book in class; if desired, I will ask the bookstore to order books.

### Learning Outcomes
Ability to write small applications in the Python programming language to facilitate data analysis and enhance research productivity
Proficiency in the use of Jupyter Notebook as a vehicle for learning and collaboration
Intermediate Python programming skills
User-defined types (classes)
Retrieving data from the worldwide web
Using the Numpy and Scipy Python packages for number crunching
Using the Pandas Python module for analysis of large data sets
Using Pandas
Advanced plotting with matplotlib
Course Assignments

### Homework assignments (80%):
Since the goal of the course is to encourage students to include programming and scripting in their daily work, an assignment will be given in each of the first 7 course sessions.

Each assignment will be in the form of a Jupyter workbook, and the workbooks will be submitted via Canvas.

Each assignment will be worth 20 points

Making programming part of your personal work flow (20%)
One of the highlights at Pycon, the international Python community conference, are sessions of "lightning talks". Lightning talks are three-minute presentations, many spontaneously developed during the conference.

Since Each student is expected to seek opportunities to use programming in their personal work or research, our last class session will be a Lightning Talk session devoted to student presentations of a way they've used programming during the semester that was unrelated to the programming course. This can be a topic related to other coursework, research, or just a fun outside activity, and can be a Python application or other programming activity.

### About the instructor

I am a 1998 SPEA Ph.D. graduate, having studied under Dr. Henk Haitjema. I also hold a B.S. in Chemical and Petroleum-Refining Engineering from Colorado School of Mines. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a process and process-control engineer in the chemical and plastics industries. As part of that work, I developed simulation tools as part of process-improvement projects

After graduate school, I worked for two years at the South Florida Water Management District as a Senior Engineer in the Hydrologic Systems Modeling department. I returned to Bloomington as Chief Modeler for WHPA Inc., a water-supply planning consulting company. In 2008 we sold WHPA to Layne Christensen Company, the largest water-well drilling firm in the US. Our Layne Hydro team conducted numerous water-supply studies, and were awarded the 2015 National Groundwater Supply Project Award by the National Groundwater Association. In April 2016, I left Layne to become the City of Bloomington Utilities Director. CBU is responsible for water supply, wastewater treatment and storm water management in the city of Bloomington.

I am the author of several software products, including the U.S. EPA code WhAEM for Windows, GFLOW, and the open-source AEM code ModAEM. Since 1998, I have done quite a lot of computer programming for hydrological analysis in the Python language, and have taught dozens of scientists and engineers to use Python in their daily work.

### Official University Policies:

#### Students with Learning Disabilities:  
Students with a learning disability, hearing impairment, speech impairment, or any other disability that may affect their ability to fulfill a requirement of the College should contact the Disability Services for Students in Franklin Hall 096, (812) 855-7578, prior to registering. Requirements will not be waived for students with disabilities; however, some modifications may be made within specific courses.

#### Religious Holidays:  
To ensure freedom of religious observance throughout our increasingly diverse population, a set of Calendar Principles were approved by the Bloomington Faculty Council, including a Religious Holidays Policy. This policy requires instructors to make reasonable accommodation when a student must miss an exam or other academic exercise because of a required religious observance. Under IU policy, students are required to request accommodation for religious observance before, not after, it occurs. Instructors should include information about accommodation and the deadline for requesting it in their syllabi. Students are not required to supply evidence of their attendance at the religious services or events in order to qualify for any accommodation granted to them.

#### Academic Misconduct:  
Academic misconduct is defined as any activity that tends to undermine the academic integrity of the institution. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, the following: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, interference, violation of course rules, and facilitating academic dishonesty. The faculty member may take into account the seriousness of the violation in assessing a penalty for acts of academic misconduct. The faculty member must report all cases of academic misconduct to the dean of students, or appropriate official. The university may discipline a student for academic misconduct.

Sexual Misconduct:

As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.

If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)

Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)

IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.
